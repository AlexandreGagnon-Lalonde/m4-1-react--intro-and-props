## Setup

This workshop uses **Create React App**, a project from Facebook designed to make it easy to get started building a React application.

It comes with a full build system, and very little boilerplate. We will learn more about this system in the future, but for now we'll focus on using it, not understanding how it works.

Open a terminal, and `cd` into the same directory that this README lives in. Then run:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn start
```

The first command installs the third-party dependencies (like React), and the second command starts a development server.

It works similarly to `nodemon` - when you save a file, it should auto-restart, and you can refresh your page to see the latest code.
